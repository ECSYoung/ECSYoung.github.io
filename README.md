# ECSYoung.github.io

Thank you for coming to take a gander at my profile! I'm currently still in bootcamp @ Juno College of Technology, and will be until March 20th officially! Please feel free to take a look at what I'm doing below! (6 projects in total + a portfolio!)

Links to each project:

1. <a href= "https://github.com/ECSYoung/sui-young-project-one" target= "_blank">Project 1 Github Repo</a>  ||  <a href= "https://ecsyoung.github.io/sui-young-project-one/" target="_blank">Live</a><br>
Notes: First project using only floats and no flexbox, and making this responsive was a challenge. Still I'm proud of how this project helped me understand the principles of float so much better. 

2. <a href= "https://github.com/ECSYoung/sui-young-project-two" target= "_blank"> Project 2 Github Repo</a>  ||  <a href= "https://ecsyoung.github.io/sui-young-project-two/" target= "_blank">Live</a><br>
Notes: We were able to use flexbox in this one, I didn't use a wrapper on this one, so I'll have to go back and add that.

Notes: I've always wanted to have a mobile tarot app for my favorite deck (featured here). I set out to make one! The readings come from Tarot.com, the images also. So all credit goes there, and to the creater of the Winged Spirit Tarot, David Sexton. I created the 78 card object, with nested arrays and objects. Refactored 1x only, and streamlined my code to do exactly what I wanted it to do in under 200 lines. The file reads as ofer 1600, but that's the data array. We weren't supposed to use a cloud storage, or firebase, so all the information had to live locally. I still have some things I'd like to improve on here, some animations, a bit better intuitive direction for the user, and optimizing the images so the load time is much faster. I hope you enjoy! 

4. <a href= "https://github.com/palate-designer/naveenSui" target= "_blank"> Project 4 Github Repo</a>  ||  <a href="https://palate-designer.github.io/naveenSui/" target= "_blank">Live</a><br>
Notes: This app was created in partnership with Naveen Malhotra in my cohort 25. We both had the idea for a food app, that paired food with wine and what not. I loved the idea of being able to customize your search by the ingredients you already had in the home. The api we used from Spoonacular was great for the information it gave, though unfortunately, not for useability as we later found out. We only had 150 free calls, and each click for functionality used up around 20 calls. Meaning, we could only really make 7 clicks a day on the app. I strongly considered purchasing the monthly subscription which drastically increases the number of calls we could make a day, but the cost was too heavy for my pockets. If you try it out, and it doesn't work, please try again in 24 hours! Sorry for the inconvenience.

5. <a href= "https://github.com/ECSYoung/suiYoungCohort25Chat" target= "_blank"> Project 5 Github Repo</a>  ||  <a href="https://ecsyoung.github.io/suiYoungCohort25Chat/" target= "_blank">Live</a><br>
Notes: One of my long time dreams, or maybe fantasy, was to create an app that has the functionality of instagram, whatsapp, facebook, and twitter all in one. This project was the first attempt at making one of those parts. I was told that making a functional multi-user chat app would take too long, and that it had taken past students too much time. I accepted this at first, and in my search for different ways to authenticate single users, I found the github API which allowed me to do a soft call without authentication and use the username that came up along with their github avatar. I had thought at first that I may have bit off more than I could chew, and in finding this API, and seeing the way I could use this seamlessly in my project made the functionality 1000% faster, better, and smoother. I learned so much about this project, including the uses of components, state, props, and "this". I implemented async and await, along with my api call, and a ".then" to have the chat display scroll to bottom once the user's information was taken on prompt. This project was stress tested during my 90 second presentation, where I asked 30-40 people to log in at the same time, and I'm very pleased that the app held up in functionality!
I'm very proud of this given I was able to make this in a week. There's still plenty to improve:
<div>
<ul>	
  <li>I'd like to make the chat display continuously scroll to the bottom when a new message comes up.</li>
  <li>I'd like to add a click sound on enter/click on the send button.</li>
  <li>Perhaps include some functionality to recognize links, images (though I'd have to integrate this project with another storage database that can take images)</li>
  <li>include user authentication, that requires logging into the github account in order to use the app</li>
  <li> tie in user authentication with message deletion, so that only the user can delete their own messages.</li>
</ul>
</div>

6. <a href= "https://github.com/ethicalMakeupC25/project6" target= "_blank"> Project 5 Github Repo</a>  ||  <a href="https://ethicalmakeupc25.github.io/project6/#/project6/" target= "_blank">Live</a><br>
A react based application that uses google’s firebase realtime database, authentication and Makeup API’s data to provide a list of real vegan and cruelty free based cosmetic products available. With this, we were able to sort by brand, product, and do partial searches to find a list of products and filter by price, rating, and alphabetical order. Deployed with HashRouter to allow for server-side access on any website. A team work project shared between myself and 3 others to create a seamless experience.<br>
We had a great deal of trouble with deployment, and learned that BrowserRouter works locally because it's a client side service, while HashRoute is server side service and allows the url pathing through react-router-dom to maintain it's browser data history and refresh appropriately without leading to a 404 error. With teamwork, and great trial and error challenges, we managed to figure this one one and deploy and submit the project on time.<br>
Please feel free to take a look at your leisure and let me know what you think!<br><br>
 
  Thanks so much for stopping by!
  Please come back soon for a link to my portfolio once completed!
